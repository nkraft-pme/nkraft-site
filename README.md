# nrkaft-site
This is the code behind the one-page resume/business card site that I'm currently working on. This site is built old-school -- vanilla CSS in the <head>, hand-typed HTML, fast as lightning due to its very light footprint. The only bit of extravagance at the moment is the web fonts I'm loading in to give it some flair.
